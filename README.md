# Sinhala Handwriting Recognition

This project is an Express.js server that uses TensorFlow.js to classify Sinhala handwritten characters from uploaded images. It processes the images, runs predictions using a pre-trained model, and returns the predicted Sinhala character through an API. This system is designed to assist in recognizing Sinhala handwriting, and can be extended with additional features or improved model accuracy.

## Features
- Accepts image uploads via an API endpoint.
- Preprocesses images and predicts Sinhala characters using a TensorFlow.js model.
- Provides real-time predictions for Sinhala handwriting.

## Tech Stack
- **Express.js**: Web server framework.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling image uploads.
- **TensorFlow.js**: For model loading and prediction.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment.
- **fs**: File system operations to read uploaded images.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sinhala-handwriting-recognition.git
    ```
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd sinhala-handwriting-recognition
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Place your TensorFlow.js model files in the correct directory (`path/to/web_model` in the code).

5. Run the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## API Endpoints

### POST `/predict`
- **Description**: Accepts an image file and returns the predicted Sinhala letter.
- **Body**: Multipart form-data with an `image` field.
- **Response**: 
    ```json
    {
      "predicted_letter": "à¶š"
    }
    ```

## Example Request

Using `curl`:
```bash
curl -X POST -F "image=@/path/to/image.png" http://localhost:3000/predict
